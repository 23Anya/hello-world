I am a **senior** at *SUNY-ESC*. 
>I must not fear.
>Fear is the mind-killer.
>Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration
>I will face my fear.
>I will permit it to pass over me and through me
>And when it has gone past I will turn the inner-eye
>To see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.
>**Only *I* will remain.**<
